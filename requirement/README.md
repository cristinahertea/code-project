# Requirement

In the requirements folder you can find images, photoshop files, SVGs and `my-cv-v2-junior.xd` which will help you get connected with the project through visuals.

I recommend to you to download the free version of [**Adobe XD**](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/xd.html) to open the _xd_ file. It'll make your life so much easier and less headaches.

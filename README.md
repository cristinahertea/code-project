# How to start
1. If you are a `mentored` or `wise` member of `CodeTap Academy` you want to get in touch with your **mentor-assistant** or **mentor** so they can create for you a dedicated branch. (***Skip this step if you are not wise or mentored member***)
1. Find the `Fork` button located in the top right area of this window and click on it. If asked, select your personal **GitHub** account. Watch this project being copied over, it should only take a few seconds.
1. Now you're in the project on your own profile. You want to find the big green button that helps you make a clone to your computer, labeled **Clone or download**. Click on it, copy the path to it.
1. Open a console like `Git Bash`, `Bash`, `Terminal`, `CMD`, `PowerShell` etc, navigate to the place where you keep your projects and run: `git clone [paste the path to the project in here]` and hit the `Enter` key. The command should look like 
```
git clone https://github.com/marianzburlea/my-cv-v2-junior
```
or
```
git clone git@github.com:marianzburlea/my-cv-v2-junior
```
1. Change into your project using `cd my-cv-v2-junior` and install dependencies using `npm i`
1. Open the project in your editor. If you have Visual Studio Code installed you can do it using `code .` and start your local development server using `npm start`
1. If you are **wise or mentored member** of Codetap Academy you want to change into your personalised branch using `git checkout [my GitHub username]`. It should look like: `git checkout marianzburlea` (***Skip this step if you are not wise or mentored member***)
1. Finally, create your first branch for the **About me** section, using `git checkout -b [username-first-branch-name]`. It should look like: `git checkout -b marianzburlea-about-me`
1. **Happy hacking** and have fun following this amazing course!

## How to get better and earn money with this project
One of the best adivce I can give you after you finish first time this project for the first time through following this tutorial is for you to do it one more time, at least. This time your main goal is to force yourself to do it with your own ideas, content, colors, positions etc. Basically you follow the video course and while you follow it, you want to pause and then traslate it to your own idea. For example: if the menu in the course doesn't have rounded corners but you feel you want some corners that aren't so sharp, go for it. 

Once the change is done, press play, understand the idea that is presented to you in the next step, translate it to your own and repeat until the entire project is done.

If you choose to trust me and understand that repeating it will give you far more understanding and sharpen your skills, than a good approach is to ask all your friends and close ones to build for them their online CV and let them know that there is a fee. At the end they can chose to pay you: all, nothing or any amount they want, no matter what reasons they have for their choice. You'll master and get better at dealing with clients and have the option to also earn something in the process.

Being able to build websites has nothing to do with being able to interact with a client, just like being able to build bikes has nothing to do with being able to sell bikes.

## Requirement

Please check the `requirement` folder and the files in it to have a better understanding of what we want to achieve.

Make sure you read the requirement instructions. You can do this in **Visual Studio Code** by opening the `README.md` file inside the `requirement` folder and pressing `CTRL + SHIFT + V` or by opening this link https://github.com/codetapacademy/my-cv-v2-junior/tree/master/requirement

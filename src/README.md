# Welcome

This is the `src` folder where you should keep all your coding files. Unless you really know what you're doing, it is highly recommended to only work in this directory.
There are a few exceptions.

1. You should change the `package.json` config section to meet your needs. If you plan to deploy to https://github.io make sure to update the `config.githubUrl` to match your project.
1. Definitely update the contents of the `README.md` file from the root of the project (not this file) at least when you're done with the project if not sooner.

consider adding at least `index.pug` to this folder to start
